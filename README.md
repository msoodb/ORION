# ORION
Lightweight, secure, and time-synchronized radio communication protocol for embedded systems. Designed for STM32 and similar MCUs, ORION provides TDMA-style messaging with AES encryption, replay protection, and optional frequency hopping â€” ideal for RC vehicles, drones, and tactical links.

// ORION depends on:
// - CMSIS (STM32F1 series) 
// - FreeRTOS (any recent version)
// These must be provided by the parent project.
